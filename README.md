# 🚀 Prerak Rana – Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio, built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, inspired by the sleek and modern [AstraRise](https://astrarise.vercel.app) design.

This site showcases my skills as a **MERN Stack Developer**, including my background, projects, and contact information — all wrapped in a clean, dark-themed UI.
